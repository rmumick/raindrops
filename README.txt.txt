This is a game that you can move an umbrella around to catch raindrops. The score increases when the umbrella catches a raindrop. The game is over after 20 seconds.
Glitches:
-raindops don't disappear exactly around the edges of the umbrella because of its unusal shape
-start button has fillets where you can still press to start the game although the button doesn't appear to be there
